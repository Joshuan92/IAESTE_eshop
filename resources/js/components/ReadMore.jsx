        <div className="about-content">
                IAESTE Czech Republic is a member of IAESTE a.s.b.l., an independent, non-for-profit organisation registered in Luxembourg, which was founded in 1948 and currently operates at least in 85 countries worldwide. Its main goal is to enable technical university students to travel abroad and gain professional experience through the IAESTE international traineeship programme.
                <br/>
                <br/> 



                In the Czech Republic, IAESTE also organizes HR projects, which are listed in the ESHOP. The organization is run by students of diverse study backgrounds, who do so on a voluntary basis in their free time. Their aim is to bring together universities and companies and facilitate new opportunities.

              <strong><h3>Job fairs</h3></strong>
              <strong>Career fairs are the main IAESTE HR project.</strong>

              Held directly at university premises, the job fairs attract a large number of students, offering companies direct contact with potential employees. Students approach them with CVs and companies can find new employees or just raise awareness about their business.
              <br/>
              <br /> 



              Companies can also increase their profile among students by organizing a workshop or a contest or by bringing their own atypical stand. IAESTE takes care of promotion of the job fairs and the organization of the events.

              <ul>
                  <li>The IAESTE international traineeship 
                  programme is the main IAESTE activity 
                  worldwide.</li>
                  <li>IAESTE provides students of Czech universities 
                  with traineeships abroad and foreign students 
                  with traineeships in the Czech Republic.</li>
                  <li>IAESTE traineeships last from 6 weeks to 1 year.</li>
                  <li>Trainees are university students usually in their 
                  3rd â€“ 5th year who best fit professional, 
                  academic and language criteria set by future 
                  employers. The employer has the final say in 
                  hiring a particular trainee.</li>

              </ul>
              Thanks to the accreditation by the Ministry 
              of Education, there is no legal relationship between 
              employers and trainees, which considerably reduces 
              the costs of taking up a trainee. Employers pay 
              trainees a living allowance, which is paid monthly 
              by IAESTE without any deductions. The total paid 
              sum is invoiced to the employer at the end of the 
              traineeship. IAESTE also handles all paperwork, such 
              as supporting documents for visa applications, and 
              organizes cultural programme for trainees during the 
              summer.
